# How "Moonlight" became "Moonlight"

Let's make things clear first about the title for those who might not know, the website you are currently viewing is designed under my "Moonlight" design language but before we start talking about moonlight let's take a look back and explore various designs i've worked with.

# The early days

When I first started my web-development journey back in September last year I wasn't really doing front-end but more like assisting Prawich (SS Developers). At that time we we're developing [System13](https://system.ssdevelopers.xyz/) which was under the "Chocolate Cosmos" design language which was the way Prawich liked when designing things. He liked dark schemed colors and very cool looking.

# Timetables

Timetables was a really big part of SS Developer's journey because it was a very massive project. That meant me and Prawich had to break of into frontend and backend, that meant I had more control over the design now so of course "Azalea" (The Design language for Timetables) felt more "me" since I was the lead designer. Azalea had a very playful look very colorful fresh look.
